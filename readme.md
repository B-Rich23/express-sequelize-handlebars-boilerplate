### Express Sequelize Handlebars Boilerplate

This project renders views in two different ways so you can choose how you want to code!

- The blog template uses handle bars to display data on the page server-side
- The authors and cms templates use jQuery ajax to retrieve data on the client, and then builds the view with jQuery dom manipulation
